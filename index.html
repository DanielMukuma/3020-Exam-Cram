    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals with Teal Accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is restructured into a comprehensive digital textbook. The top-level navigation is updated to four main pillars: Creativity, The Campaign, Copywriting, and Outdoor Advertising. This creates a more logical information hierarchy. Each pillar contains its own sub-navigation with tabs for deep dives into theory, examples, and a dedicated glossary, as requested. This modular, hierarchical structure allows the user to study a broad topic or drill down into a specific concept, making it a powerful, non-linear learning tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application uses nested tabs to organize a large volume of information from multiple source documents into digestible chunks. Key concepts like "Slogan vs. Tagline" are presented in a clear, comparative table inspired by the provided image. The radio script examples are formatted for readability. The principles of billboard design are presented as a checklist. This structure and choice of interactive elements transform dense notes into an engaging and highly organized study experience. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                        <h3>What is Creativity?</h3>
                        <p>Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. It is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, and to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. Critically for advertising, a product is creative when it is both **(a) novel** and **(b) appropriate**. A novel product is original and not predictable. An appropriate product is useful and serves the client's objective.</p>
                        <p>Creativity involves two processes: thinking, then producing. If you have ideas but don't act on them, you are imaginative but not creative. Everyone has "everyday creativity," and it is a skill that can be developed, not an innate talent.</p>
                        <h4>Thinking Outside the Box</h4>
                        <p>This refers to thinking in a creative, innovative way by looking at a problem from a different perspective. It requires you to first understand the "box" (the status quo and its limitations) and then challenge it. This approach helps to solve problems more effectively, identify overlooked opportunities, and foster a culture of innovation.</p>

                         <h3>The 5-Stage Creative Process</h3>
                         <p>This is the evolution of an idea into its final form, first articulated by Graham Wallas. It provides a structured journey for developing creative concepts.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1. Preparation:</strong> The research phase. You gather information, conduct brainstorming sessions, and immerse yourself in the problem. This is where you collect the raw materials for your idea.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. Incubation:</strong> You step away from the problem and let your subconscious mind work. This period of not actively thinking is crucial for your brain to make new, unexpected connections.</li>
                            <li><strong>3. Illumination:</strong> The "aha!" or "eureka!" moment. A new idea or the solution to the problem suddenly emerges into your consciousness. It often feels like a flash of insight.</li>
                            <li><strong>4. Evaluation:</strong> You critically analyze the idea. Is it strategically sound? Does it meet the objectives? You refine and improve it here, ensuring it's not just new, but also useful.</li>
                            <li><strong>5. Verification:</strong> The execution phase. This is the hard work of bringing the idea to life—writing the copy, designing the layout, and producing the final ad.</li>

                        <h3>Fundamentals of Copywriting for Print</h3>
                        <p>Print copy is divided into two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Display Copy:</strong> All elements a reader sees in their initial scan. Its purpose is to grab attention. This includes the **Headline** (the most crucial element), **Subheads**, **Call-outs** (labels pointing to visuals), **Taglines** (wraps up an ad's idea), and **Slogans** (a brand's long-term motto).</li>
                           <li><strong>Body Copy:</strong> The main text of the ad, designed to be read and absorbed. It explains the idea, provides details, and persuades the reader.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Key Writing Techniques</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Sell Benefits, Not Features:</strong> A feature is what a product *is* (e.g., "a 1-inch drill bit"). A benefit is what it *does for the customer* (e.g., "makes a 1-inch hole"). Always lead with the benefit.</li>
                           <li><strong>Avoid "Adese":</strong> Steer clear of clichés and brag-and-boast copy (e.g., "quality you can trust at a price you can afford"). It's predictable and easy to ignore.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div id="copy-radio" class="sub-content-pane">
                        <h3>Copywriting for Radio</h3>
                        <h4>Theater of the Mind</h4>
                        <p>Radio's unique power. Without visuals, the copywriter must use audio to create powerful images and stories in the listener's imagination. Research shows using imagery in radio leads to higher attention and more positive attitudes toward the ad.</p>
                        <h4>The Audio Toolkit</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Voice:</strong> The most important element. It conveys the personality of the speaker (e.g., a child, an expert, an announcer).</li>
                           <li><strong>Music:</strong> Creates mood, establishes setting, and makes messages memorable through jingles.</li>
                           <li><strong>Sound Effects (SFX):</strong> Cues the setting and action (e.g., waves crashing, a phone ringing).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Radio Script Sample: "Taste Test"</h4>

                           <li><strong>Slice of Life:</strong> A mini-drama presenting a real-life problem that the product solves.</li>
                           <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Focuses on the user and their identity rather than product features.</li>
                           <li><strong>Animation:</strong> Uses cartoons or graphics, effective for complex messages or reaching children.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Storyboard</h4>
                        <p>A storyboard is a visual script, a series of frames that pre-visualizes the ad. Its two main purposes are: <strong>1) To get client/management approval</strong> before spending money on production, and <strong>2) To serve as a guide for the film crew</strong> during the shoot.</p>

                        <h3>The Oldest Form of Advertising</h3>
                        <p>Outdoor advertising consists of any ad displayed out of doors, such as posters, painted signs, and light signs. It is a widespread medium with high coverage, making it ideal for mass-appeal products.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Outdoor Advertising</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Posters/Advertising Boards:</strong> The most common form, exhibited on hoardings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vehicle Advertising:</strong> Moving ads placed on or inside buses, taxis, and trains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electric & Neon Signs:</strong> Attractive illuminated signs, common in cities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sky Advertising:</strong> Modern forms like skywriting or large balloons.</li>
                            <li><strong>Street Furniture:</strong> Ads on bus shelters, benches, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advantages & Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> High coverage and frequency (24/7 accessibility), geographic flexibility, long life, and effective for building brand awareness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Message must be **fleeting** (brief and crisp), audience measurement is very difficult, and it can be perceived as "visual pollution".</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Best Practices for Billboard Design</h3>
                        <p>With an average dwell time of only 4 seconds, billboard design must be impactful and instantly understandable.</p>
                        <h4>The Rules of Three and Seven</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The 3-Second Rule:</strong> A viewer must be able to read and understand your entire message in 3 seconds or less.</li>
                            <li><strong>The 7-Word Rule:</strong> The optimal length of text for a billboard is seven words or fewer. People process visuals 60,000 times faster than text.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Key Design Elements</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>One Big Idea:</strong> Focus on a single, memorable message. Don't be boring.</li>
                            <li><strong>One Strong Image:</strong> Use one impactful, high-resolution image. Clutter is the enemy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clear Branding:</strong> The logo should be large and clear, taking up significant space for brand recall.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Contrast & Bold Fonts:</strong> Use contrasting colors and legible, bold fonts to ensure maximum readability from a distance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid Direct Response:</strong> Do not rely on viewers writing down a phone number or website. The goal is brand recall, not immediate action. A simple Google search should be enough for interested viewers to find you.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Fleeting Message:</strong> A key characteristic of outdoor ads; the message must be understood very quickly as the audience is in motion.</li>
